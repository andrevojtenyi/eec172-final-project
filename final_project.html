  <h1>Dual Control Pong</h1>
  <h2>EEC 172 Spring 2025 Final Project</h2>
  <p>
    A simple game of Pong played with two different controllers. One of the paddles is controlled by the accelerometer on the CC3200, and the second one is controlled by the IR receiver and remote combo. After the game is over, the winning player is prompted to enter a three-letter name using the same algorithm as the one we wrote in Lab 3. AWS IoT is then used to send the name to a Google Sheets, which tracks and ranks the number of wins per name, which is then supposed to be displayed as a leaderboard.
